/*
1.Time Complexity  --It is used to measure efficiency of algorithm in term of speed, as the input size grows.

time complexity != time taken

Speed Efficiency ---> When input size grows.


Linear Search                        
n = 10 , x = 10
n = 100 , x = 100
n = 1000 , x = 1000

Binary Search
n = 10 , x = 3
n = 100 , x = 7
n = 1000 , x = 10

Binary Search Efficiency >>>> Linear Search Efficiency

2. Big O notation ----Big O noattion represent worst case time complexity

Linear Search 
[5,6,1,0,7]
Best Case - Search(5)
Worst Case - Search(100)
Linear search --> O(n)



Binary Search 
[5,6,7, 10 ,12]
Best Case - Search(10)
Worst Case - Search(100)
Binary Search ---> O(log n)

Efficiency 
O(log n) >> O(n)


O(n2) --- loop in loop , this one is more worst than O(n)
O(n log n) ---- Merge Sort
O(n3)
O(2n)
O(1)

O(1) > O(log n) > O(n) > O (n log n) > O(n2) > O (2n) > O(n!)
