A.Linked List
Linear data structure
Nodes are linked together by a reference field

B.Two type of Linkedlist:-
1.Singly Linked List
2.Doubly Linked List 

C.Single Node
|Value| Pointer|
| Previous Pointer||Value| Next Pointer|

D.Head
Starting Point of Linkedlist

E.Difference Between Linkedlist and Array
Array - Linear , non-Contigenous ,  Fixed Size(can be dynamic),Just Value , Getting element is easy O(1), Insertion/deletion is complex,Memory Efficient
Linkedlist - Linear , Contigenous ,Dynamic size (chnage easily), Node = Value+Pointer,Getting element is hard O(n),Insertion/deletion is easy, Extra Memory

F.If you want to...                                  Use
Access elements by index fast                     Array
Insert/delete at head or tail frequently          Linked List
Memory-efficient storage for static size           Array
Avoid resizing overhead or unknown size upfront    Linked List
Do lots of traversal/manipulation                  LinkedÂ List
