3	Recursion
	Function call itself to solve smaller version of the same problem
3.1	Two Parts of recursion
	"Base case - stop condition (when to stop calling itself)
Recursive case - Part where function call itself"
	Infinite recursion leads to Stack OverFlow.
3.2	"Common Mistake
1.Base Case -- Stack overflow
2.Not Simplfying the input --- never reach the base case
3. Too Deep recursion --- large input
4. Keep in mind the time complexity"
3.3	"When to use Recursion
1.Problem can be broken into sub problems
2.Trees and Graph
3. Backtracking , DP, Divide and conquer"
